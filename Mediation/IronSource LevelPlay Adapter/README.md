## App-ads.txt
Please set up [app-ads.txt](https://kidoz.net/app-ads.txt) for all the apps that use Kidoz sdk. This will increase your fill rate and earnings and will prevent ad serving being blocked.
Follow these instructions on how to [Set up an app-ads.txt file for your app](https://kidoz.net/introappadstext).


## CPM Setup
You will need to define your Ad Unit CPM as displayed in your Kidoz dashboard. Contact a Kidoz publisher representative for more information at sdk@kidoz.net.
